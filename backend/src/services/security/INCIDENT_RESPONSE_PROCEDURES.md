## 🎯 Overview

This incident response plan defines the systematic approach for detecting, analyzing, containing, and recovering from security incidents in the Travel Planner application ecosystem.

### Objectives
- Minimize business impact and damage from security incidents
- Preserve evidence for forensic analysis and legal proceedings
- Maintain service availability during incident response
- Learn from incidents to improve security posture
- Ensure compliance with regulatory requirements

## 🚨 Incident Classification

### Severity Levels

#### CRITICAL (P0) - Immediate Response Required
**Timeline: 15 minutes**
- Active data breach with confirmed data loss
- Complete system compromise
- Ransomware or destructive malware
- Critical infrastructure failure affecting all users

**Response Actions:**
```javascript
// Automated critical alert handling
if (alert.severity === 'critical') {
  await emergencyShutdown.initiate();
  await notificationService.alertSecurityTeam('immediate');
  await forensicsService.preserveEvidence();
}
```

#### HIGH (P1) - Urgent Response Required
**Timeline: 1 hour**
- Suspected data breach or unauthorized access
- Privilege escalation attempts
- Successful brute force attacks
- Denial of service attacks

**Response Actions:**
```javascript
// High-priority incident workflow
if (alert.severity === 'high') {
  await isolationService.quarantineAffectedSystems();
  await auditService.enhanceLogging();
  await notificationService.alertIncidentTeam();
}
```

#### MEDIUM (P2) - Standard Response
**Timeline: 4 hours**
- Failed intrusion attempts
- Policy violations
- Suspicious user behavior
- Minor security control failures

#### LOW (P3) - Routine Response
**Timeline: 24 hours**
- Information gathering attempts
- Routine security events
- Non-critical policy violations

## 👥 Response Team Structure

## 🔍 Detection and Analysis

### Automated Detection Triggers

```javascript
// Security monitoring service detection logic
class IncidentDetectionService {
  async evaluateSecurityEvent(event) {
    const riskScore = await this.calculateRiskScore(event);
    
    if (riskScore >= 90) {
      return this.createIncident('critical', event);
    } else if (riskScore >= 70) {
      return this.createIncident('high', event);
    } else if (riskScore >= 50) {
      return this.createIncident('medium', event);
    }
    
    return this.logSecurityEvent(event);
  }
  
  async createIncident(severity, triggerEvent) {
    const incident = {
      id: generateIncidentId(),
      severity,
      status: 'investigating',
      createdAt: new Date(),
      triggerEvent,
      timeline: [],
      evidence: [],
      affectedSystems: []
    };
    
    await this.initiateResponseWorkflow(incident);
    return incident;
  }
}
```

### Manual Detection Sources
- Security analyst review of alerts
- User reports of suspicious activity
- Third-party security intelligence
- System administrator observations
- External notifications (partners, authorities)

### Initial Analysis Checklist

1. **Incident Verification**
   - [ ] Confirm incident is genuine (not false positive)
   - [ ] Identify affected systems and data
   - [ ] Assess potential impact and scope
   - [ ] Document initial findings

2. **Impact Assessment**
   - [ ] Number of affected users
   - [ ] Types of data potentially compromised
   - [ ] Business processes impacted
   - [ ] Regulatory implications

3. **Evidence Preservation**
   - [ ] Capture system logs and network traffic
   - [ ] Take forensic images of affected systems
   - [ ] Document system states and configurations
   - [ ] Preserve audit trails

## 🔒 Containment Procedures

### Immediate Containment (Short-term)

#### For Compromised User Accounts
```javascript
async function containCompromisedAccount(userId) {
  // Immediate account lockout
  await userService.disableAccount(userId);
  
  // Revoke all active sessions
  await sessionService.revokeAllSessions(userId);
  
  // Rotate API keys
  await keyRotationService.emergencyRotation(userId);
  
  // Enhanced monitoring
  await auditService.flagForEnhancedMonitoring(userId);
  
  logger.critical('Account contained due to compromise', { userId });
}
```

#### For System Compromise
```javascript
async function containCompromisedSystem(systemId) {
  // Network isolation
  await networkService.isolateSystem(systemId);
  
  // Disable remote access
  await accessService.disableRemoteAccess(systemId);
  
  // Snapshot current state
  await forensicsService.captureSystemSnapshot(systemId);
  
  // Alert monitoring team
  await alertService.notifySystemCompromise(systemId);
}
```

#### For Data Breach
```javascript
async function containDataBreach(breachDetails) {
  // Stop data flow
  await dataService.suspendDataAccess(breachDetails.affectedDataSets);
  
  // Preserve audit logs
  await auditService.preserveAuditTrail(breachDetails.timeRange);
  
  // Notify legal team
  await notificationService.notifyLegalTeam(breachDetails);
  
  // Prepare breach notification
  await complianceService.prepareBreach Notification(breachDetails);
}
```

### Long-term Containment

1. **System Hardening**
   - Apply security patches
   - Update security configurations
   - Implement additional monitoring
   - Review access controls

2. **Network Segmentation**
   - Isolate affected network segments
   - Implement additional firewall rules
   - Monitor network traffic patterns
   - Restrict lateral movement capabilities

## 🧹 Eradication and Recovery

### Eradication Steps

1. **Remove Malicious Components**
   - Delete malware and backdoors
   - Remove unauthorized accounts
   - Clean infected systems
   - Patch vulnerabilities

2. **Security Control Enhancement**
   - Strengthen authentication requirements
   - Implement additional monitoring
   - Update security policies
   - Enhance logging and alerting

### Recovery Procedures

```javascript
class RecoveryService {
  async initiateSystemRecovery(incidentId) {
    const incident = await this.getIncident(incidentId);
    
    // Phase 1: Validate eradication
    const eradicationConfirmed = await this.validateEradication(incident);
    if (!eradicationConfirmed) {
      throw new Error('Eradication not complete');
    }
    
    // Phase 2: Restore from clean backups
    await this.restoreFromBackups(incident.affectedSystems);
    
    // Phase 3: Enhanced monitoring
    await this.implementEnhancedMonitoring(incident.affectedSystems);
    
    // Phase 4: Gradual service restoration
    await this.gradualServiceRestoration(incident.affectedSystems);
    
    // Phase 5: User communication
    await this.notifyUsersOfRecovery(incident);
  }
  
  async validateRecovery(systemId) {
    const checks = [
      this.verifySystemIntegrity(systemId),
      this.confirmSecurityControls(systemId),
      this.validateDataIntegrity(systemId),
      this.testSystemFunctionality(systemId)
    ];
    
    const results = await Promise.all(checks);
    return results.every(result => result.passed);
  }
}
